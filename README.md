# Keep Talking CR

This repository contains the source code of the Central Registery "Keep Talking" project, which is a module to register users using WebAuthn for nodes to fetch their OfferIDs. 

Because the "Keep Talking" is a decentralised project, the managed registration would optional and replaceable. However, the ICEServer which is crucial for WebRTC to discover peers is not, but you may choose your favourite servers. 

# ðŸš§ This Repo is Under Construction ðŸš§

...and it's far from done

## Roadmap

Even the roadmap is a rather ambiguous one:

- [x] Make WebAuthn backend kinda working (SQLite would do). 
- [ ] Complete Models. 
- [ ] Pass the minimal testing.
- [ ] Eventually the signalling server will be integrated into this project, but let's use Google's Firebase for now...
- [ ] ...
